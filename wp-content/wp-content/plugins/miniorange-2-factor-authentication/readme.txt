== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I gain access to my website if I get locked out using the Google Authenticator? =

You can obtain access to your website by one of the below options:

1. If you have an additional administrator account whose Two-Factor - 2FA is not enabled yet, you can log in with it.
2. If you had set up KBA questions earlier, you can use them as an alternate method to log in to your website instead of the configured 2FA method.
3. Rename the plugin from FTP - this disables the Google Authenticator - WP 2FA plugin and you will be able to log in without 2FA.
